SEO Overview

SEO is a process of making your website more searchable by having the right keywords implemented in your content.  Having an optimized website, helps improve the quantity and quality of visitors.  A crawler is used to search your website by looking at the content inside your header tags; starting with H1 all the way to H6 with H1 being the most important and H6 being the least important.  This process helps determine how much in common you have with searchers thus improving your ranking on the search results and earning your website free marketing.

Analytics is another tool that can help market your website on the internet.  The analytic tool tells you who is using your website and what content they are more interested in.  Having this data on hand, is very helpful to web developers as it helps them see where their website would need improvement to attract more traffic.


SEO Proposal

In order to attract more traffic to my website and improve my ranking in search results, I would like to do some of the following changes to my website.

First, I would include more header elements on every page as I learned that the crawler would be targetting that on a page.  Currently, I have limited myself to only one H1 on a page but unfortunately, I have a limited amount of headers across my web site.  On the home page, I can swap the H3's for H2's and the H5's for H3's.  This would bring up the level of importance on the content found in those headers thus increasing my chances of scoring higher.  Second, keywords to target the right searchers, is another area that would really give my website a boost.  If I add words like 'training', 'healthy', 'stamina', 'active', 'mental health', 'rejuvenate', 'happy' across the website, I feel that it will increase traffic. Finally, adding backlinks to other websites about running such as all the running clubs I have on the homepage as well as runsignup.com would make my website more easily accessible to runners or anyone who is looking to be more active.

Once all of the things I mentioned above are implemented, using a tool to obtain analytics data will help determining if my visitors are using the website as it's meant to and/or if further changes need to be made to increase traffic.
